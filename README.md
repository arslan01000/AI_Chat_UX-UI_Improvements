# ChatGPT UX/UI Enhancement: Smart Navigation Bar Concept

This project explores a user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) improvement for ChatGPT — specifically, the integration of an enhanced navigation bar aimed at boosting multitasking, accessibility, and productivity for users.

## 🧠 Idea Overview

The goal is to design and prototype a smarter, more efficient navigation system for ChatGPT (both web and mobile), focusing on:
- Seamless switching between active chats
- Easier access to tools, files, and settings
- Cleaner, more intuitive layout that improves user flow

## 📌 Why This Matters

As daily ChatGPT users, we see opportunities to make its interface more intuitive and workspace-friendly. This repo will document the process from concept to prototype, with the hope of pitching it to OpenAI for collaboration, contribution, or potential implementation.
